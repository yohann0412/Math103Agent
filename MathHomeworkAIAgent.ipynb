Denote by \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) the minimal polynomial of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) over \\\\( F \\\\).\\n\\n**Claim.** The minimal polynomial \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) is irreducible in \\\\( F[x] \\\\).\\n\\n**Proof:**\\n\\nRecall the definition of the minimal polynomial:\\n\\n- \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) is monic,\\n- \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\),\\n- \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) has minimal positive degree among all nonzero polynomials in \\\\( F[x] \\\\) vanishing at \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).\\n\\nSuppose, towards a contradiction, that \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) is **not** irreducible in \\\\( F[x] \\\\). Then there exist nonconstant polynomials \\\\( f(x), g(x) \\\\in F[x] \\\\) with degrees strictly less than \\\\(\\\\deg m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x)\\\\) such that\\n\\\\[\\nm_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) = f(x) g(x).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\), we have\\n\\\\[\\nf(\\\\alpha)g(\\\\alpha) = 0.\\n\\\\]\\nIn a field extension, this implies that either \\\\( f(\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\) or \\\\( g(\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nWithout loss of generality (the argument is symmetric), suppose \\\\( f(\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nBut then \\\\( f(x) \\\\in F[x] \\\\) is a nonzero polynomial of positive degree less than that of \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) (since \\\\(\\\\deg f(x) < \\\\deg m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x)\\\\)) and vanishes at \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). This contradicts the minimality of the degree of \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\).\\n\\nThus, \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) cannot be factored into nonconstant factors in \\\\( F[x] \\\\); that is, \\\\( m_{\\\\alpha,F}(x) \\\\) is irreducible in \\\\( F[x] \\\\).\\n\\n\\\\(\\\\boxed{}\\\\)'"
